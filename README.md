# DNNISS4RF
In this study, an intelligent surrogate system for fluid simulations is proposed by introducing deep neural networks (DNNs) to investigate the radio-frequency (RF) discharge characteristics efficiently, instead of discretization processes to solve the fluid equations. The DNNs are employed as the basic component to construct the intelligent surrougate system by solving the continue equations. The prediction data obtained from the well-trained surrogate system can accurately and efficiently reveal the temporal-spatial evolution, such as electron density, ion density, electric field strength, electron flux, ion flux, and electron temperature.
